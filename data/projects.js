The Alumni office asked us to build it because the system used by the AdDU Alumni Office is manual and hard to keep up. Record-keeping and accessibility are not easy since there is much data to be saved and overseen. That's why the purpose of this web app is to assist the AdDU Alumni Office in keeping and tracking the records easily so that it will lessen their load and do what they do best.",
